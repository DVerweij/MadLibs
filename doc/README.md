The following app is a Mad Libs app. Mad Libs is a game where a user has to input certain kinds of words to fill up a story, but this story is not seen until all the placeholders are filled in.
The app reads in a random story and asks the user to put in certain types of words like adjectives, nouns or even a Name of a person or city.
To offer some help to the user, the app provides examples for the type of word in question. 
The app also prevents wrong inputs like a word when the app asks a number or a string containing numbers or punctuation marks when asked for a word.
The user is free to randomly choose another story as well and restart completely when the app is complete.
